# DeFi Tokens Wiki


## Overview
DeFi Tokens Wiki is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) DeFi tokens.

The repository contains token metadata for DeFi tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

[Dharma](https://dharma.io) uses token metadata (e.g., social links, description, logo, tags, etc.) from this source. Tokens added to this repository are also indexed on Uniswap.

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _contributions are welcome_,
primarily from token projects.


## Contribution Quick Start

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
